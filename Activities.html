                    <p class="card-text">For stunning scenery and a very relaxed atmosphere, the waterways of the Upper Noosa River are a firm favourite. With camp sites accessible by canoe and a choice of walking tracks, you can spend a weekend (or longer) exploring Cooloola Recreation Area in Great Sandy National Park.

                        After heavy rains, Lake Broadwater on the Darling Downs is the perfect spot for canoeing, not to mention birdwatching, picnicking, walking and camping. So pack up the kids and the kayaks and enjoy the great outdoors.
                        
                        For stunning scenery of orange sandstone walls, emerald green lily-carpeted waters and deep blue skies, venture into the waters of beautiful Lawn Hill Gorge in Boodjamulla. Drift through the gorge and look for turtles, fish and many kinds of birds—Lawn Hill Creek and the lushly vegetated gorge are an oasis for local wildlife.

                        In fact, almost any of the small islands of the Great Barrier Reef provide excellent opportunities for kayaking—exploring fringing reefs and discovering hidden beaches. Just make sure your camera is waterproof!
                        
                        The Whitsunday Ngaro Sea Trail is one of Australia’s most unique cultural experiences, following in the wake of the Ngaro people in a journey blending island seaways and sensational walking tracks. Island-hop to your heart’s content, or join a guided tour over turquoise water to one of the three islands—Whitsunday, Hook and South Molle—on the trail.

                    <p class="card-text">Marine Parks Zoning provides a balanced approach to protecting the marine and intertidal environments while allowing recreational and commercial use. Check zoning information and maps(external link) before entering or conducting any activities in the marine parks.
                      
                      Fisheries regulations apply—information on bag and size limits, restricted species and seasonal closures is available from Fisheries Queensland.
                      
                      There are public moorings in the waters around Frankland Group National Park. Moorings reduce coral damage from anchors and provide safe and sustainable access to popular reefs and islands. They suit a variety of vessel sizes and are accessed on a first-come-first-served basis. Time limits may apply during the day, but all mooring are available overnight between 3pm and 9am. Learn more about moorings and responsible anchoring and see maps and mooring locations(external link).
                      
                      Visitors should check weather conditions and obtain updated forecasts before venturing out in recreational vessels. Weather forecasts are available from the Bureau of Meteorology(external link).
                      
                      Please note that there are group size limits and other restrictions for commercial operators under the Cairns Area Plan of Management(external link).

                      Camping permits are required and fees apply for High Island.
                      
                      Russell Island is a Commonwealth island and a camping permit must be obtained in advance. No camping fees apply.

                    <p class="card-text">The fringing reefs surrounding the Frankland Islands are a great place to enjoy swimming, snorkelling and diving. The best snorkelling is on the north and south-west sides of Normanby Reef and on the north and west edges of Russell Island. Take care not to kick or stand on corals.

                      Dangerous stinging jellyfish (‘stingers’) may be present in the coastal waters at any time, but occur more frequently in the warmer months. A full-body lycra suit or equivalent may provide a good measure of protection against stinging jellyfish and sunburn. Visit marine stingers(external link) for the latest safety and first-aid information.
                      
                      Be aware that crocodiles can occur in the waters around island national parks in North and Central Queensland. Crocodiles are potentially dangerous and attacks can be fatal.
